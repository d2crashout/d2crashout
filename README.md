# 👋 Hi, I’m Abhi!

> “The best way to learn how something works is to take it apart.”  

I’m a curious middle school student who loves exploring the world of hardware and code. You’ll often find me tinkering with microcontrollers, digging into PC guts, or modding Minecraft. Breaking things down—and building them back up—fuels my passion for learning.

### 🛠️ What I’m into:
- **Hardware Hacking:** Microcontrollers (MCUs), PCs, and anything I can safely (!) disassemble
- **Coding:** Java, HTML, Minecraft Modding, and Home Assistant automations
- **Reverse Engineering:** Taking things apart, seeing how they tick, and maybe making them better

---

### 🚀 Projects I’m proud of:
- [**video-fetcher**](https://github.com/d2crashout/video-fetcher): Grab and process online videos with ease(work in progress)
- [**TI-32**](https://github.com/chromalock/TI-32): A project I contributed a change to
- [**math-stuff**](https://github.com/d2crashout/calc): Cool multi-language calculator
- [**pink-garnet**](https://github.com/d2crashout/pinkgarnet): A cool minecraft mod I am working on

### 🧠 Fun Facts:
- I love to take stuff apart just to see what’s inside.
- Minecraft modding is my digital playground.
- If it’s got a circuit board, I want to know what it does!
